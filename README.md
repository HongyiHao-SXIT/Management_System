# C++ Management System Learning Repository
## I. Repository Introduction
This repository is designed to provide a series of practical management system examples for C++ learners, including Student Information Management System, Student Grade Management System, Library Management System, etc. These systems are all written in C++. By practicing these projects, you can deeply understand the characteristics and applications of the C++ language, enhance your object - oriented programming ability, and improve your problem - solving skills.

## II. Repository Content
1. **Student Information Management System**: It enables operations such as input, query, modification, and deletion of students' basic information (such as name, student ID, age, gender, class, etc.). Through file I/O operations, student information is persistently stored in local files for easy data preservation and reading.
2. **Student Grade Management System**: Focuses on the management of student grades, including grade input, query, and statistical analysis (such as average score, highest score, lowest score, etc.). Data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, or more complex data structures) are used to efficiently store and process grade data, and a user - friendly interactive interface is provided.
3. **Library Management System**: Simulates the daily management work of a library, including book addition, borrowing, returning, querying, as well as user (reader) registration, login, and borrowing record management. Through the design of classes and objects, various entities in the library (such as books and readers) are abstracted into C++ classes to implement the system's functional logic.

## III. Learning Value
1. **Language Learning**: These projects are excellent materials for learning the C++ language. By reading and analyzing the code, you can learn basic C++ syntax, object - oriented programming features (such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism), file operations, exception handling, and other knowledge.
2. **Practical Ability Enhancement**: During the learning process, you can modify and expand the existing systems according to your own understanding, such as adding new functions, optimizing algorithms, and improving the user interface, thereby improving your programming practical ability and problem - solving skills.
3. **Project Experience Accumulation**: Participating in the learning and practice of these projects helps you accumulate project development experience, understand the basic processes and norms of software development, and lay a solid foundation for participating in more complex project development in the future.

## IV. Usage Instructions
1. **Download the Repository**: Use the `git clone https://github.com/HongyiHao-SXIT/Management_System.git` command to download this repository to your local machine, or directly download the compressed package on the Github page and unzip it.
2. **Compile and Run**: Each management system has corresponding source files. You can use a C++ - supported compiler (Visual Stdio Code + MinGw64) for compilation. Enter the directory of the corresponding system in the command line, execute the compilation command, and then run the generated executable file.
3. **Learning Reference**: Read the comments in the code to understand the code logic and implementation ideas. At the same time, you can refer to the documents in the repository (if any) to understand the system's design principles and usage methods.

## V. Academic Integrity
1. **Strictly Prohibit Plagiarism**: Please do not submit the code in this repository directly as your own homework or project. The code is only for learning and reference. You should write your own code to complete relevant tasks by understanding and learning.
2. **Proper Citation**: If you refer to the code in this repository during the learning process, please make appropriate citations and explanations in your academic works to avoid academic misconduct.

We hope this repository will be a powerful assistant for you to learn C++. Have a pleasant learning experience! If you have any questions or suggestions during the use, welcome to submit Issues or Pull Requests.
